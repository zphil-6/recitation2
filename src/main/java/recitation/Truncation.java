 * Exercise 6 — Casting chops, it does not round.

 * Java will happily widen a small type into a bigger one on its own, but it
 * will never narrow one for you — int x = 3.5; does not compile. You have to
 * say (int) and take responsibility for what gets lost.
 *
 * And what gets lost is everything after the decimal point. (int) 3.9 is 3.
 *
 * The last method here is the exact trick Skill Builder 1 asks you to use.
