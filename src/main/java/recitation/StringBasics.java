/**
 * Exercise 8 — Reaching into a String.
 *
 * Everything here you already do in Python. The names are different and the
 * brackets are gone:
 *
 *     Python              Java
 *     len(s)              s.length()
 *     s[0]                s.charAt(0)
 *     s[0:3]              s.substring(0, 3)
 *     s[-1]               s.charAt(s.length() - 1)
 *
 * Java has no negative indexing. The last character is always length() - 1,
 * and you will write that expression for the rest of the semester.
